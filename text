Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to integrate an external API to fetch and display real-time news headlines on a news website. This task will assess your ability to work with external APIs, handle data responses, and seamlessly integrate the functionality into a sample news website.

API Documentation:
- API Provider: News API
- API Documentation: [News API Documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines)

Requirements:

1. Frontend Integration:
   - Create a new section on the homepage of the news website to display the latest headlines.
   - Display at least 5 headlines along with the article source and publication date.

2. Backend Integration :
   - your application has a backend, create a route to fetch news headlines from the News API.
   - Cache the responses to reduce the number of API calls.

3. Error Handling:
   - Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails.
   - Display a user-friendly message if there are issues fetching the headlines.

Technical Considerations:

1. Frontend:
   - Use a modern frontend framework or library (React).
   - Fetch data from the News API using asynchronous requests (e.g., fetch or a library like Axios).

2. Backend :
   -  use a backend technology Node.js to act as an intermediary between the frontend and the News API.

3. API Key:
   - Sign up on the News API website to obtain an API key.
   - Include the API key in your requests for authentication.

4. Data Display:
   - Display the fetched headlines in a visually appealing format on the homepage.

Submission Guidelines:

1. GitHub Repository
 
2. Code Organization:
   - Organize your code into clear and well-documented structures.
   - Include comments to explain complex sections of your code.

3. Instructions:
   - Provide a README.md file with instructions on how to set up and run your application locally.
   - Clearly mention any additional libraries or dependencies required.

Assessment Criteria:

1. Successful API Integration:
   - Proper integration of the News API into the news website.

2. Data Handling:
   - Effective handling of API responses and displaying relevant information.

3. Error Handling:
   - Implementation of error handling for potential issues with API requests.

4. Code Quality:
   - Clean and well-structured code.
   - Adherence to coding best practices and standards.
